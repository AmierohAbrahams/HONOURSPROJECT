# Introduction

Temperature is the main determinant of biogeographical patterns and ecosystem processes, having observable effects on an organism’s survival and reproductive patterns (Smit et al. 2013). The temperatures of seawater are a key indicator of environmental changes in marine ecosystems (Pearce et al. 2006). Despite the controlling effects that temperature plays on the growth, survival, and distribution of marine organisms, little is known regarding temperatures within coastal zones. Within coastal zones seawater temperature varies as it is affected by a range of nearshore processes such as wave action, tides, and turbidity. Additionally, the thermal properties of the substratum may also affect temperature variation (Smale and Wernberg 2009) and so there is a large scope for variation at a localized scale. Given the importance of the impacts of temperature, it is imperative to understand how marine organisms may respond to temperature variation at coastal regions on both a global and local scale.

The coastal region of South Africa, spanning approximately 3113 km in length (Smit et al. 2013), has not been studied in great detail at highly localized scales. Broadly, we know that this region exhibits a large variation in seawater temperatures across its coastline (Mead et al. 2013; Smit et al. 2013) and is divided into three distinct coastal regions, each with contrasting temperatures. These are the cold temperate west coast, warm temperate south coast, and the subtropical east coast. These regions display noticeable differences in seawater temperatures in comparison to each other, primarily due to the influences of neighbouring ocean currents (Bolton et al. 2004; Mead et al. 2013; Schlegel and Smit 2016).

The South African coastline is bordered by the Benguela and Agulhas Currents on the west and east coasts respectively. The Benguela Current is characterised as transporting cold water northwards from the Southern Ocean (Hutchings et al. 2009; Schlegel et al. 2017), whereas the Agulhas Current, western boundry current, transports sub-tropical, warm water towards the tip of Africa (Smit et al. 2017). Together these two currents are responsible for the presence of a strong West-East thermal gradient occurring along the coastline of South Africa, with the west coast having severely colder waters than the east coast. (Smit et al. 2013). The South coast is unique as it affected by both the Bengula and Agulhas currents. In this way, the south coast region differs from the other two coastal regions as it experiences greater variations within its localized thermal gradient due to the influences of two contrasting ocean currents (Lutjeharms and Ballegooyen 1988). These currents can vary in as much as 10°C (Schlegel et al 2017) within a 24hour period thus creating fluctuations in seawater temperatures around the Western Cape region. The Agulhas Current is driven by wind stress curl between the southeast trade winds and the Southern Hemisphere westerlies (Beal et al. 2011). The Agulhas current retroreflects once making contact with the Benguela current and may often run into the South Atlantic ( Hutchings et al., 2009) thus resulting in warm Indian Ocean water to move into the Atlantic at depths exceeding 2000m (Beal et al., 2011; Schlegel et al. 2017). These currents strongly affect the seawater temperatures around South Africa, and recent studies have shown that the temperatures of these have been changing. 

The statistical properties such as the mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures of in situ coastal seawater temperature time series representing the entire South African coastline show distinct coastal variations as a result of the Agulhas and Benguela currents (Schlegel and Smit 2016). Due to the small range of ambient temperatures experienced on the West coast, fluctuations are able to occur over a short period of time. Research has found that the seawater temperatures of the Benguela Current has been decreasing at a rate of approximately 0.5 °C per decade, and the Agulhas Current has been increasing by between 0.55 °C - 0.7 °C per decade (Rouault et al. 2009; 2010). Overall, sea surface temperatures (SST) around South Africa has increased by approximately 0.25 °C between 1903 and 2013 (DEA, 2013) and is still increasing at a rate of 0.12 °C per decade (Schlegel and Smit, pers. comm.). The exact causes of these changes are not fully known, but we do know that human presence have an influence on coastal seawater temperature

Due to their proximity to populated or infrastructural areas, coastal regions are more readily accessible by humans to fully marine and open ocean regions. As a result, these areas are more susceptible to changes in both temporal and spatial scales are more(Help et al 2011; kennish and Elliot 2011; Sink et al. 2012; Mead et al 2013). Along the South African coastline direct pressures include exploitation of coastal resources, pollution and modification of communities (Griffiths et al 2004; Sink et al. 2012; Mead et al 2013). These changes may directly be influenced by anthropogenic activity and hence promoting climate change which ultimately influences air temperature, wind and sea surface temperature (Mead and Robinson 2011; Rouault and Mead 2011; Mead et al 2013).

Over the last few decades, improvements in remote sensing technology have enabled researchers to map global sea surface temperature with a high level of accuracy (Zainuddin et al. 2006; Smale and Wernberg 2009). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) series of satellites have provided global SST datasets from the 1980s at both global and local scales (Pearce et al. 2005). This data is critically important as satellite temperature datasets are often used to monitor changes in ocean temperatures and provide valuable information on both biological and physical parameters in the ocean (Demarcq et al. 2010). Furthermore, satellite-derived SST data plays an important role in the creation of projections for the potential effects of climate change on coastal and oceanic marine biota (Muller et al. 2009; Hilbish at al. 2011; Bartsch et al. 2012). Satellite-derived data are not as reliable as in situ measurements of temperature, but are often used as a proxy when these measurements are not available or scarce (Smale and Wernberg 2009). 
Developments of in situ collected coastal temperature data products over the last three decades provide a more reliable source of accurate coastal seawater temperature data (Smit et al. 2013). The South African Coastal Temperature Network (SACTN) has collected SST data for the South African coastline from as early as 1972, with contributions from various organisations and governmental departments. This data was obtained via a combination of different instruments and methods, including hand held alcohol thermometers and underwater temperature recorders, and as a result of this disparity, the coastal seawater temperature data has been recorded at differing levels of precision (0.5°C and 0.001°C respectively) but are likely more reliable than satellite derived data.

Satellite-derived temperature measurements often differ from in situ measurements (Katsaros 2003; Castillo and Lima 2010). This is primarily due to coastal satellite measurements failing to record small-scale variability or provide realistic information on mean climatological temperatures. Smit et al. (2013) have shown that within offshore environments satellite data generally reflects reality and have been validated against in situ measurements. At coastal regions however it was found that satellite-derived data had a warm bias of 6 °C when compared to coastal in situ collected seawater temperature data. For study sites located within a 400 m distance of the shoreline, it is recommended that data collected in situ be used over satellite-derived temperatures where possible (Smit et al. 2013).

## Study area

The South African coastline provides a large area for temperature recordings via satellite and in situ measurements (Schlegel and Smit 2016). In order to compare variations of temperature between sites along the three coastal regions, datasets for temperature, wind, and wave action are required. Wind, wave action, and exposure were important variables in this study as they exhibit a direct influence on coastal water temperatures. Existing thermal and wave energy data for all sites were available apriori to be used in analysis in order to investigate the impact of abiotic parameters on seawater temperature at specific sites along the South African coast.

## Temperature data

 The SACTN temperature dataset was compiled by measuring coastal seawater temperatures at 135 sites along the coast of South Africa, daily from 1972 until 2017. Temperatures were measured either manually using hand-held thermometers or electronically using underwater temperature recorders (UTRs). Of the 135 sites, 87 were measured using thermometers and the remaining 48 were measured using UTRs. Predominantly along the east coast of South Africa, data from those sites were collected using glass thermometers from boats at the shark net locations along the coastline. Both alcohol and glass thermometers allows for a precision of 0.1 °C, the recordings are recorded at 0.5 °C. Seven sources contributed towards the compilation of this dataset: The Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA), South African Weather Services (SAWS), University of the Western Cape (UWC), Department of Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), Kwa Zulu Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB), South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON) and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife Organization (EKZNW). KZNSB and SAWS made use of hand-held alcohol thermometers, and took measurements 20 cm below the sea surface. DEA, DAFF, SAEON, UWC and EKZN used UTRs to obtain seawater temperature recordings at each of the sites. Electronic instruments used for seawater temperature recordings have improved over the past four decades. Previous UTRs collected seawater temperature at a precision of 0.01°C whereas current models collect temperature at a thermal precision of 0.001°C. The temperature data that are manually recorded using thermometers are saved and extracted annually. 
 
The purpose of this study is to examine variations of temperature between selected sites along the South African coastline using SST data in order to better understand patterns of coastal temperature patterns at a localized scale. Additionally, this study also intends to examine the influence of environmental factors, namely, wave action and exposure on coastal seawater temperatures. The aims of this study are to: i) examine whether there is homogeneity between the various sites sampled, ii) examine the driving factors that cause variation in coastal seawater temperatures along the South African coastline and iii) to examine whether the different instruments used in this study showed similar or different temperature values at the same sites.
