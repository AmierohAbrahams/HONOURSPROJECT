##Introduction

Temperature is the main determinant of biogeographical patterns and ecosystem processes, having observable effects on an organism’s survival as well as their reproductive patterns. 
Despite the important role that temperature plays on the terrestrial and marine environment, little is known in regards to the effect of environmental factors as well as the variation across coastal seawater temperatures. Studies regarding photosynthetic organisms focus mainly on those found in the inshore coastal zone. This zone extends from the intertidal region till a few hundred meters from the shoreline. Temperature is the main driver of species turnover, however wave action, salinity and turbidity may also have a significant impact on this process. 

Local scale physical factors influence the temperature profiles in the nearshore. The seawater temperatures found around South Africa’s coastline exhibits a large variational range.  
The coastal region is divided into three provinces, namely the cold temperate west coast, warm temperate south coast and the subtropical east coast. The Agulhas and Benguela currents, are the two currents that influence the two oceans surrounding South Africa. These two adjacent currents create a strong thermal gradient along the shores of South Africa and can vary up to 10°C on any given day, creating the observed fluctuations in seawater temperature. The Benguela Marine Province (BMP) is located to the west of Cape Point and is characterized by the movement of cold water from the Southern Ocean moving north.
The cold temperate west coast mentioned above is greatly affected by the upwelling caused by offshore winds, generated by the cold Benguela current. Due to the small range of ambient temperatures experienced on the west coast, fluctuations are able to occur over a short period of time. 

The Agulhas Current is considered to be the strongest western boundary current, globally, producing meanders that expel continual eddies into regions including the Agulhas Retroflection and Cape Basin. The Agulhas Bank Ecoregion located to the east of Cape Point, makes up the western half of the Agulhas Province, which is governed by the warm Agulhas Current that flows south along the east coast of South Africa. The Agulhas current serves as the trigger of a potential climate feedback mechanism. Eddies, fronts, and filaments influenced by the Agulhas Current are vast, both quantitatively as well as spatially, exhibiting sharp horizontal sea surface temperature (SST) gradients. These gradients have a great impact on air and sea thermodynamics, in both a local and regional capacity.

On a global scale, ocean’s thermal regimes are maintained by currents as well as latitudinal solar heat flux gradients. On a local scale (<10 km), at the land/sea margin, additional unfamiliar physical phenomena contribute to the thermal patterns and dynamics, differing from those on a mesoscale (i.e., spatial scales > 50 km). The properties of the temperature regime, responsible for setting up biogeographical patterns are less understood in this region, specifically at regional and local scales, in close proximity to land where satellite data poorly reflects reality (Smit et al., 2013). Due to these inconsistencies, annual mean temperatures are often used in cases where temperature is recognised as a major driver of species distribution. Satellite derived data is often consulted as the source of these annual mean temperatures. 
Over the last few decades, improvements in remote sensing technology, has enabled researchers to map the global sea surface temperature (SST), with a higher level of accuracy. This is important as satellite temperature datasets are often used to monitor changes in oceanic temperatures.  Satellite-derived SST data plays an important role by projecting the effects of climate change on coastal and oceanic marine biota. There has been a development in gridded data products over the last three decades, used by the South African Coastal Temperature Network (SACTN), as early as 1972, to create sea temperature datasets. In some regions the temperature records contained in these diverse datasets have been validated against precise in situ temperature measurements, true for offshore regions where satellite data generally reflects reality. Satellite-derived temperature measurements can often differ from in situ measurements, as coastal satellite measurements often fail to record small-scale variability or provide realistic information on mean climatological temperatures. For study sites located within a 400m distance of the shoreline, it is recommended that data collected in situ be referred. 
The purpose of this paper is to examine the temperature variation observed between a number of different sites located along the South African coastline as well as to examine the influence of environmental factors, namely, wave action and exposure on costal seawater temperatures. The aims of this study are to; i) examine whether there is homogeneity between the various sites sampled, ii) examine the driving factors that cause variation in coastal seawater temperatures along the South African coastline. These aims will be achieved by examining the wave and coastal seawater temperature datasets in order to test the amount of variability between the sites located along the coast. 
 


##Aim 

The aim of this study is to examine whether there is homogeniety between the sites and which physical variables shows a similar trend in changes per month. The study is also aimed at examining the driving factors causing a difference in seawater temperatures along the South African coastline. This will be achieved by examining the wave and coastal seawater temperature datasets to test the amount of variability between the sites along the coast. 

##Study area 

The South African coastline spans 3100 km providing a large area for temperature recordings via satellite and manual measurements needed for the study. Bordered by the Benguela Current, the west coast of South Africa is significantly different  from the remaining two coasts , forming an Eastern Boundary Upwelling System, whilst the east coast is dominated by the western boundary Agulhus current. The south coast, also bordered by the Agulhas Current, differs from the east coast as it experiences both shear-forced and wind driven upwelling. In order to compare the temperature variation between the sites along the coast, datasets for both temperature and wave action were analyzed. 
Wave action and exposure were important variables in this study as they exhibit a direct influence on coastal temperature. Wave action encompasses a number of specific parameters including wave height, direction and period, of which, not much information regarding their influence on temperatures is known as sites are either exposed or sheltered from this form of wave action. Existing thermal and wave energy data for all sites were analyzed in order to investigate the impact of abiotic parameters on seawater temperature at the specific coastal sites. 
Previous studies suggest that the oceanic temperatures located in these regions, analyzed in the study, are constantly changing. This is evident as an increase in seawater temperature along the Agulhas Current and a decrease in seawater temperature along the southern Benguela Current has been recently reported.


## Method 

The SACTN temperature dataset was compiled by measuring coastal temperatures at 135 sites along the coast of South Africa, daily from 1972 until 2017.   Temperatures were measured either manually using hand-held thermometers or electronically using underwater temperature recorders (UTRs). Of the 135 sites, 87 were measured using the thermometers and the remaining 48 were measured using UTRs. Seven sources contributed towards the compilation of this dataset, namely; The Department of Environmental Affairs(DEA), South African Weather Services(SAWS), University of the Western Cape(UWC), Department of Forestry and Fisheries(DAFF), Kwa Zulu Natal Sharks Board(KZNSB), South African Environmental Observation Network(SAEON) and  Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife Organization(EKZNW).  KZNSB and SAWS made use of hand-held alcohol thermometers, and took measurements 20cm below the sea surface. DEA, DAFF and EKZN used the UTRs, attaching them at depths of 4m and 9m. SAEON data was collected at a depth of 3m whilst UWC data was collected at a depth of 1m, both using the UTR devices. Thermometers and UTR devices were the preferred choice of equipment as satellite SST is regarded as unreliable in terms of measuring coastal sea water temperature. The thermometers used in this study were accurate to 0.5°C, and the UTR devices used were accurate to 0.001°C .

# Data

## Wave data

Wave energy data formed part of the South African Coastal Vulnerability Assessment, presented to the Department of Environmental Affairs. The data was calculated using NOAA Wave Watch III (WWIII) in association with National Centers for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) products as the numerical input. Hindcast data from WWIII ranged from 1994-2013 at a 3-hour resolution. The data were then used to model short crested waves generated by the wind into the coastal environment, using Simulating Waves in the Nearshore(SWAN). 

## Statistical analysis
Redundancy Analyses (RDA) were performed to examine the impact of environmental drivers on the coastal seawater temperature. The RDA performed linear regressions between response and explanatory variables, enabling one to calculate the amount of variation in response variables as explained for by explanatory variables. 
Multiple regressions were performed to compare the differences between variables, these variables being the physical factors that affected temperature. 
Pairwise correlations were plotted to test whether wave and temperature parameters correlated with one another. Therefore fluctuations in the mean, minimum and maximum values were included as temperature parameters.
