##Introduction

Temperature is the main determinant of biogeographical patterns and ecosystem processes. Seawater temperature has a large effect on the survival and reproduction of marine organisms at various scales and effect the biochemical and physiological rates in organisms. One example of a biogeographic distribution that is limited by seawater temperature is kelp, where increasing temperature gradients reduce kelp distribution. All the ocean heat virtually comes from the sun, because of this heat input at the surface, the surface layers of the sea is the  warmest and the temperature decreases with depth. Temperature and hydrodynamic flow not only influence the distribution of organims, but have shown to affect the morphology of these organisms. Increased temperature also reduces the photosynthetic rate, as well as a substantial decrease in respiration.

Remote sensing technology improvements over many decades have allowed researchers to map the global sea surface temperature (SST) at increasing resolutions. Satelite temperature data sets are widely used for monitioring the changes in ocean temperatures. Satellite-derived SST data are being used to predict effects of climate change on the coastal marine biota. The need for suitable seawater temperature records has encouraged the development of gridded data products spanning the satellite era for the last three decades and/or longer instrumental data ranging back to 1972 in the South African coastal temperature network (SACTN) data set. In some regions the temperature records contained in these diverse datasets have been validated against precise and accurate *in situ* temperature measurements, this however may be true for offshore regions where satellite data generally reflect reality. It is known that satellite-derived temperature measurements may differ from *in situ* measurements. Satellite measurements often failed to record small-scale variability or provide reliable information on temperature. 

The application of gridded SSTs to the coast are not accurate or reliable, this however is not widely known and many different regions across the globe simply do not have suitable *in situ* coastal temperature datasets available. Thus it has been strongly recommended to make use of in situ data to support research conducted within 400m of the shoreline. Where records of *in situ* coastal seawater temperature do exist, the reliability of these datasets could be used in place of the remotely sensed SST data.

Physical factors largely influence biological systems in the marine environment and may influence the temperature profiles. There is a large variation in the seawater temperature along the South African coastline, where the Benguela and Agulhas currents are the two major currents and govern the marine environment in the nearshore environment. The Benguela Marine Province (BMP) lies West of Cape Point and is characterised by cold water moving north from the Southern Ocean via the Benguela current. The Agulhas Bank Ecoregion lies east of Cape Point . This ecoregion makes up the western half of the Agulhas province, which is governed by the warm Agulhas current that flows south along the east coast of South Africa. The two currents can vary in as much as 10°C on a single day. Thus this variation results in fluctuations in seawater temperatures. Various process such as coastal upwelling occur along these coasts. This is the process where winds blow surface water offshore. Thus winds play a role in the ocean temperature variation by driving various processes such as upwelling and downwelling. 


##Aim 

The aim of this study is, therefore, to examine whether there is homogeniety between the sites and which physical variables shows a similar trend in changes per month. The study is also aimed at examining the driving factors causing a difference in seawater temperatures along the South African coastline.This will be achieved by examining the wave and coastal seawater temperature datasets to test the amount of variability between the sites along the coast

##Study area 

The South African coastline spans 3100 km providing a large area for temperature recordings via satellite and manual measurements needed for the study. Bordered by the Benguela Current, the west coast of South Africa is significantly different  from the remaining two coasts , forming an Eastern Boundary Upwelling System, whilst the east coast is dominated by the western boundary Agulhus current. The south coast, also bordered by the Agulhas Current, differs from the east coast as it experiences both shear-forced and wind driven upwelling. In order to compare the temperature variation between the sites along the coast, datasets for both temperature and wave action were analyzed. 
Wave action and exposure were important variables in this study as they exhibit a direct influence on coastal temperature. Wave action encompasses a number of specific parameters including wave height, direction and period, of which, not much information regarding their influence on temperatures is known as sites are either exposed or sheltered from this form of wave action. Existing thermal and wave energy data for all sites were analyzed in order to investigate the impact of abiotic parameters on seawater temperature at the specific coastal sites. 
Previous studies suggest that the oceanic temperatures located in these regions, analyzed in the study, are constantly changing. This is evident as an increase in seawater temperature along the Agulhas Current and a decrease in seawater temperature along the southern Benguela Current has been recently reported.


## Method 

The SACTN temperature dataset was compiled by measuring coastal temperatures at 135 sites along the coast of South Africa, daily from 1972 until 2017.   Temperatures were measured either manually using hand-held thermometers or electronically using underwater temperature recorders (UTRs). Of the 135 sites, 87 were measured using the thermometers and the remaining 48 were measured using UTRs. Seven sources contributed towards the compilation of this dataset, namely; The Department of Environmental Affairs(DEA), South African Weather Services(SAWS), University of the Western Cape(UWC), Department of Forestry and Fisheries(DAFF), Kwa Zulu Natal Sharks Board(KZNSB), South African Environmental Observation Network(SAEON) and  Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife Organization(EKZNW).  KZNSB and SAWS made use of hand-held alcohol thermometers, and took measurements 20cm below the sea surface. DEA, DAFF and EKZN used the UTRs, attaching them at depths of 4m and 9m. SAEON data was collected at a depth of 3m whilst UWC data was collected at a depth of 1m, both using the UTR devices. Thermometers and UTR devices were the preferred choice of equipment as satellite SST is regarded as unreliable in terms of measuring coastal sea water temperature. The thermometers used in this study were accurate to 0.5 °C, and the UTR devices used were accurate to 0.001°C .

#Data

#SACTN- temperature data

The temperature data was obtained from SACTN (South African coastal temperature network).
The statistical properties of in situ seawater temperature time series representing the
whole coastline which includes the mean, minimum and maximum temperature which vary greatly among the different coastal sites as a result of the two major South African currents.

# Wave data
Wave energy data formed part of the South African Coastal Vulnerability Assessment, presented to the Department of Environmental Affairs. The data is  forecasted using NOAA Wave Watch III (WWIII), with National Centers for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) product as the numerical input. Hindcast data from WWIII range from 1994-2013 at a 3-hour resolution. The data are then used to model short crested waves generated by the wind into the coastal environment, using Simulating Waves in the Nearshore. SWAN allows one to extract wave parameters from specific locations in the nearshore.


# Statistical analysis
Redundancy Analyses (RDA) were performed to examine the impact of environmental drivers on coastal seawater temperature. An RDA performs linear regressions between response and explanitory variables. This allows the one to calculate the amount of variation in response variables explained for by explanatory variables. Response variables were represented by temperature measurements, with wave measurements selected as explanatory variables. Multiple regression to compare the differences between variables, these variables are the physical factors that affect temperature. Pairwise correlations were plotted to test whether wave and temperature parameters correlate with one another around the coast.Therefore fluctuations such as minimum, maximum, range and standard deviations were included as temperature parameters, and standard deviations were included as wave parameters.
